    <p>  Its no secret that Facebook - one of the most sucessful social media platforms every created - has an infamous past of mishandeling the data of their users, with Wired Magazine reporting a 14-year history of mishaps in user privacy in 2018. Starting in 2007, facebook experienced many technical issues such as a glitch where the PHP code was displayed where the homepage was supposed to be (Cubrilovic, techcrunch.com), the case of Cambridge Analytica nonconsensually using information for political advertisements purposes from 2013-2016 (Chan, businessinsider.com), and facilitating emotional experimentation on their users through their newsfeed - just to name a few (Newcomb, nbcnews.com). In 2018, a court case was held in which CEO Mark Zuckerberg was interrogated by the senate for the misuse and unethical distribution of userâ€™s personal information. As a result of this court case and many others, It is estimated that Facebook has paid over 5 billion dollars in reparations for the misuse of personal information and other mishaps. </p>

<p>  I believe that it's important for us to be aware of the information that we put online and in our social media pages. However, I also believe that it is ultimately up to the responsibility of the website owners and creators that they are fully transparent and more upfront about the use of information on their website. Zucherbergs defense for many of these claims is that they offer ways out, but what he doesnt mention is that it took large backlash from the public in order for that to happen, which brings into question if the people behind Facebook ever consider morality when making these decisions. When websites are committing morally questionable acts, it should be vocalised and taken seriously. If they only react to the public outbursts, than better work needs to be done about informing the viewers of decisions being made, and the options they have in order to opt out if they so desire. </p>
